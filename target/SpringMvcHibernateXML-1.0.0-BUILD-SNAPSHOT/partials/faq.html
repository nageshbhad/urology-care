                           A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is an infection of any part of the urinary tract, such as the urethra, bladder, urethras, or kidneys. UTIs usually begin in the lower regions of the urinary tract, which is
Susceptible to bacterial contamination. It is important to seek treatment for a UTI, as untreated UTIs can spread, causing potential kidney damage and in rare cases, death.

                           A urinary tract infection is identified by changes to urinary function. Symptoms usually present as pain or burning during urination, a strong urge to urinate, urine that is cloudy in appearance, and sometimes blood in the urine. As a UTI progresses to affect other areas of the urinary tract such as the kidneys, it may induce fever, chills, nausea, and flank pain. See your urologist if you are experiencing any of these symptoms. A doctor can diagnose a UTI with a simple urine test.

                            Kidney stones are crystallized accumulations of minerals and acid salts within the kidneys. The kidneys’ function is to filter the blood and remove unwanted chemicals. These chemicals are passed out in the urine, and some are able to form crystals. The crystals grow to become stones. They are usually small – about the size of a very small pebble. However, stones as large as golf balls have been reported in some patients.

                            The diagnosis of stones is normally made based on the symptoms outlined above. To confirm the presence of a stone, urine is taken to look for blood and to exclude a urine infection and CT scan is arranged to look along the length of the urinary system at 1mm intervals so it is incredibly accurate at detecting stones. This will identify the site and size of the stone, which dictates how the stone is then treated. Sometimes "silent" stones-those that do not cause symptoms-are found on x rays taken during a general health check

                            Often, kidney stones pass from the body on their own without any urology intervention other than optional pain management. Medications are also available to help relax the urethras and allow a stone to pass more quickly.
<strong>Surgical</strong></br>
Others may require treatment, such as shock waves to help break up a large stone. Ureteroscopy and tunnel surgeries are alternative treatments used to capture and remove stones from the urethra kidneys.

                           There are many ways you can lower your risk of getting kidney stones. The National Institute of Diabetes and Kidney Diseases recommend drinking plenty of water – at least 12 glasses a day. You should also limit your intake of caffeine as this can contribute to a more rapid loss of fluids from the body. Dietary modifications and medications may become necessary if you continue to develop kidney stones despite increased water intake.
