LUTS (Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms)</a></h3>
          <p class="home"> Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a very frequent issue for both men and women and unfortunately become more common with age. In men the most likely cause is developing obstruction thanks to non-cancerous growth of the prostate gland (BPH), however, the symptoms may also relate to problems with bladder function and this too may affect women.</br> </br>

BPH</a></h3>
          <p class="home"> The term Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) relates to an enlarged prostate which is not cancerous, but which may cause bothersome problems with the waterworks or lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) thanks to the resultant obstruction to the flow of urine out of the bladder. It is a very common problem in men, the growth in the prostate probably starting in middle age. It may result in bothersome symptoms in approximately 50 percent of men ..</br> </br>

            <p class="home">Your body is made up of millions of cells which continuously renew themselves to replace old or damaged tissue. When the renewal process gets out of control whereby more cells grow than die they begin to form growths or tumours.<br><br>These tumours can either be benign (non cancerous) or malignant which are cancerous and can invade and damage healthy tissue.

           <p class="home"> Prostate cancer can also be described by stage. The stage is determined by a combination of rectal examination, symptoms and/or imaging (such as MRI and bone scan). Stage 1 describes early prostate cancer which can only be seen under a microscope. Stage 2 is early prostate cancer which can be felt on examination. Stage 3 refers to locally advanced prostate cancer  </br></br> </br>

                <p style="color:black !important;">&nbsp;   That urinary tract infections account for 1 percent of all outpatient doctor visits every year? These infections occur in people of all ages, but sexually active women are at the highest risk for UTI. In fact, women in general are much more likely to contract a urinary tract infection at the rate of 4 women to every 1 man. Other risk factors for UTI include the use of catheters or having diabetes.</p>

                <p style="color:black !important;"> &nbsp; Scientists have found evidence of kidney stones in a 7,000-year-old Egyptian mummy. Stones affect about three in twenty men and one in twenty women in the UK. They most commonly occur between the ages of 20 and 50, but can occur at any age. Unfortunately, once someone has had a stone there is a 50% chance they will form a further stone within five-ten years.</p>
