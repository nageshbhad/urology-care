 <h3>Bladder Cancer</h3>
           Bladder CancerBladder cancer is a urological disease that usually affects the cells lining the inside of the bladder. Because its symptoms are easy to identify, the disease is usually diagnosed in its earliest stages. Fortunately, bladder cancer is highly treatable; with five-year survival rates estimated at 98 percent for a stage 0 diagnosis and 88 percent for a stage I diagnosis. Bladder cancer is most common among older adults, with an average age at diagnosis of 73.</br>

that there are more than a half million bladder cancer survivors in the U.S. alone? The disease is most prevalent in male adults, though females are susceptible as well. The American Cancer Society estimates more than 72,000 new cases of bladder cancer to be diagnosed in 2013 – approximately 75 percent of which will develop in men.

 <h3>Kidney Cancer</h3>
           Kidney cancer is cancer with a primary origin in the kidneys. The kidneys, which are responsible for filtering waste from the body, are located on either side of the spine. There are several types of cancers that can affect one or both kidneys, including renal cell carcinoma – the most common form of kidney cancer found in adults. Certain risk factors increase the likelihood of being diagnosed with kidney cancer, including smoking, age, high blood pressure, and obesity. Long term prognosis is best among patients who are diagnosed and undergo treatment during the earliest stages of the disease.</br>

           <Strong>  Did you know…</Strong></br>

that the risk of developing kidney cancer is much lower than that of other urological cancers? About 1 in 63 Americans will develop the disease in their lives, with men outnumbering women nearly 2 to 1.

 <h3>Urinary Tract Infections</h3>
          A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is an infection of any part of the urinary tract, such as the urethra, bladder, ureters, or kidneys. UTIs usually begin in the lower regions of the urinary tract, which are susceptible to bacterial contamination. It is important to seek treatment for a UTI, as untreated UTIs can spread, causing potential kidney damage and in rare cases, death.</br>

 <Strong>  Did you know…</Strong></br>

that urinary tract infections account for 1 percent of all outpatient doctor visits every year? These infections occur in people of all ages, but sexually active women are at the highest risk for UTI. In fact, women in general are much more likely to contract a urinary tract infection at the rate of 4 women to every 1 man.

 <h3>Benign Prostatic Disorder</h3>
         The prostate gland is a small, walnut-shaped gland that plays an important role in sex and urination. With age, the gland may begin to grow, resulting in a condition known as benign prostate hyperplasia. This disorder may begin as early as a man’s 30’s or 40’s, although symptoms usually do not appear until many years later. Non-cancerous prostate enlargement is non-life threatening, although an enlarged prostate should be examined by a urologist.</br>

<Strong>  Did you know…</Strong></br>

that 9 out of 10 men over the age of 60 have at least some signs of benign prostatic enlargement? Doctors and researchers still have a lot to understand about this disorder, which seems to begin in many men around age 30. Millions of patients visit urologists every year due to the benign prostatic enlargement, and many undergo treatment to help avoid blockage of fluids in the urethra.

 <h3>Erectile Dysfunction</h3>
          Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a condition that affects millions of men around the world and as many as 30 million men in America. Also known as impotence, this condition impairs a man’s ability to achieve a suitable erection for intercourse. In the majority of men with ED, the condition is a physical problem caused by insufficient blood supply to the penis. However, some cases of ED are caused by psychological disruptions such as depression and performance anxiety.</br>

<Strong>  Did you know…</Strong></br>

that erectile dysfunction is a very common condition among American men? Approximately 1 in 5 men confirmed having difficulty achieving an erection in a study by the Department of Urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Risks of developing erectile dysfunction increase significantly with age. An estimated 50 percent of men age 50 or older have some degree of ED – a number that increases to 70 percent at age 70.
